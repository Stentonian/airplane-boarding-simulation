# Airplane Boarding Simulation

This project was done as part of a masters course in statistics. The task was to create an agent based model for simulating a real world scenario, with freedom to choose any scenario to model. The scenario chosen here is people boarding an airplane at the airport.

This project was done in 2018 but was never gittified or pushed to Github. The project was uploaded to Github in Oct 2022.

## Install

You will need NetLogo to run the simulation. All downloads and docs can be found [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). NetLogo comes with a GUI that allows one to load, edit and run a simulation.
